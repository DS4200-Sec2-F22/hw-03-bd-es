                    Reveal Marks and Channels

                <div id="marks1" class="marks1">
                    <h1 class="header">Marks</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li id="mark1">Areas
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This is a good choice because areas on a map represent different states in
                                    a clear and easy-to-understand
                                    fashion, as you can easily understand which areas represent which states.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h1 class="header">Channels</h1>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Color (hue)
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Color(Hue) - The results are blue for democratic and red for republican. 
                                    This is a good choice because differing hues are a perfect way to represent 
                                    the separate identities that are voting parties. Both blue and red stand out 
                                    from each other very well, so the differences in results are easily noticed.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </div>
                
                <button type="button" id="colormap_button1">
                    Reveal Colormap(s)
                </button>
                
                <div id="colormaps1" class="colormaps1">
                    
                    <h1 class="header">Colormap(s)</h1>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Categorical
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Categorical - The red states represent states that voted conservative, 
                                    and the blue states are democratic voters. This is a good choice because
                                    the red and blue hues are commonly connotated with the conservative and 
                                    democratic parties, so they can be easily understood. As mentioned before, 
                                    it also allows for the two categories to be easily distinguished from one another.

                            </ul>

                <div id="marks2" class="marks2">
                    <h1 class="header">Marks</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            Points 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This is a good choice because each point is an individually batted ball
                                    from the 2015 season
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>
                            Color (Hue and Luminance)
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This is a good choice because the different hues are easily
                                    differentiated from each other, and good/bad scoring values
                                    can be easily noticed. The luminance(darkness) of the marks
                                    also represents hits that have higher (orange) and lower
                                    (purple) scoring values.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        
                        
                        
                        <li>
                            Vertical and Horizontal Position
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The vertical position represents the launch angle, and the
                                    horizontal position represents exit velocity. This is a good 
                                    choice because the closer to the middle right the points are, 
                                    the better the contact with the ball is.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                <div id="colormaps2" class="colormaps2">

                                <li>
                                    The better scoring values can be easily distinguished
                                    from the others as dark orange, while the lower scoring 
                                    values are darker purple. The median range is white, 
                                    while the 'no data' representation is gray. This is a 
                                    good choice because the two extremes stand out, and the 
                                    median is not the same color as 'no data'.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
